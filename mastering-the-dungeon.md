# Mastering the Dungeon
As the master of the dungeon, it is your duty and privelage to host a variety of adventurers seeking **glory**, **fortune**, and **friendship** as they test their wits and prowess against the denziens and traps of your crafting. But, there is a lesser known secret, that the dungeons are constructed not to destroy the adventures utterly, but to provide a steady income to the **dungeon's true benefactor**. In your case, it is the Ancient Red Dragon known to you by the name *Hugh Manning*.

In compliance with industry regulations (The Challange Rating rules, the Dungeon Master's Guide, the Unearthed Arcana and other errata), Dungeons are a careful mirage to entice adventureres into their halls, give them a good adventure, and leave them satisfied. In return, some adventurers die in the process, leaving valuable *Magical Items*, which your benefactor desiers. Thus, the circle of the dungeons is completed.

As noted earlier, dungeons have various rewards for adventurers. Some offer dangerous monsters and traps, bountiful with  **Experience**, which adventurers seeking **Glory** would be enticed. Rumors of **Legendary Treasures** will beg for adventureres who dream of **Fortune**. And lastly, a good dungeon is a good bonding experience; Adventures who embark on a **Team-Building** journey and discover a truth about **Friendship** will be more likley to return later, more powerful and experienced.

|Reward|Type of Adventurer|Rating|
|-|-|-|
|Fortune|The Poor, The Desperate, The Greedy|Common|
|Glory|The Eager, The Strong, The Young, The Vengeful|Uncommon, Rare|
|Friendship|The Powerful, The Chosen, The Heroes|Very Rare, Legendary|

> ### Adventurer Types
> The types of advenrers your dungeon attracts and caters to may evolve over time, and some types are more challenging than other to retain.
>
> Attracting low level adventurers to fortune is easy, the mere rumor of treasures is enough to motivate the most deperate in an attempt to change their fate. These adventurers, however, are less likley to own magical gear, and if they do succeed, they are more likley than others to retire immediatly with their newfound wealth. Thus, they are useful in a pinch, but unsustainable in the long term.
>
> Adventures that seek Glory are more diffuclt to attract, as you need *survivors*, *deadly traps* rumors of *powerful monsters* as well as the monsters themselves to back them up. Such monsters are costly, and traps need design and maintinance. But an adventurers that do arrive are well equippted for the dangers, and usually have a bounty of items and valuables.
>
> The final group of adventureres, those that will discover Friendship, are amongst the most powerful of heroes, and not to be trifled with. Utilising an impressive reportiar of co-ordination, magical items, and expert skills, they will conquor almost any challenge set before them. They are typically motivated by each other, and thus do not have an easy method of attraction. However, if your dungeon is particularly renoun, or you have a personal connection to a character in the group, soothsayers and sages may speak of your dungeons in prophesies.

## Adventurers and the Economy
Obviously, to reap the bounties of your work, the adventurers need to die. This is unavoidable (in all but the most contrived of dungeons) and does come with concequences. Dead adventureres tell no rumors, don't bring more magical items, and don't level up and become more powerful; still, only once an adventurer has dies do they drop their loot, but it is important to kill adventurers in moderation.

> You should be careful not to kill all the adventurers at once, as this is suboptimal. Leaving
